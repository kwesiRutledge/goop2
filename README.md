# goop2
This project is meant to implement an optimization toolbox with nice default features like MATLAB's YALMIP. It is a spiritual successor to the goop library from MIT's Distributed Robotics Lab. This version is meant to be written in pure Go and makes use of my own low-level library for interfacing with Gurobi.
